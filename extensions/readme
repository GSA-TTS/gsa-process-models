Permission has been hearby granted from [Dan Funk](https://github.com/sartography) that the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) project of the General Services Administration (GSA) has express authority to utilize the API extensions created by Sartography in this process model fork repository. Dan Funk, or by proxy, Sartography (SpiffArena/SpiffWorkflow) reserves the right to request the removal of these extensions at any given time, to which, representatives of the FAC (Alex Steel/Bret Mogilefsky) do hereby agree that should that notice be given, prompt and immediate removal of these extensions will occur for that request.

The express purpose of adding these extensions is to understand the API side of the application as present in [SpiffDemo](https://www.spiffdemo.org) in an attempt to allow the FAC and its users the ability to perform the necessary workflow actions via API.
